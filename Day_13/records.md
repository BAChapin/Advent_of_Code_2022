# Distress Signal

At this point in AoC I am well out of my depth of experience, so credit for this solution goes to : [u/Lucews](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lucews/)
I have used their solution almost in its entirety, with very minor changes, to solve today's porblems. This was more for learning than it was for AoC credit.

| Part # | Change Summary<sup>1</sup>        | Date           | Time<sup>2</sup> |
| :----: | :-------------------------------- | :------------: | :--------------: |
| 1      | Initial Design                    | Dec 13 - 09:12 | 5.6 ms           |
| 2      | Initial Design                    | Dec 13 - 09:18 | 6.9 ms           |

<sup>1</sup> This will clarify the change that was made to change the time metrics.

<sup>2</sup> This is the time metrics for each puzzle. They include the time to open and read the `input.txt` file. They will be abbreviated as appropriate. i.e. 1.54945 will be "1.5 s", 0.00127 will be "1.3 ms", and 135.21574 will be "2 m 15 s"
