# Advent of Code - 2022

This is my 2022 Advent of Code<sup>1</sup> (AoC) repository.

Similar to last year, I will be using Python again this year to take on the AoC challenges.

Also like last year, I will continue using the same organization. I will also time my functions and record their output in `records.md` files within each day.

### Organization

## Get Involved

I have created a private leaderboard on Advent of Code for up to 199 people to join, feel free to jump in and play along. Each day solving the 2 challenges earning stars. The private leaderboard's join code is `1048725-41c081f6` Once the 199 spots have been filled I will remove this portion of the readme, and at the end of the month post the top 5 people on the leaderboard.

**Note:** _The leaderboard is retro-active, so if you've already done the days leading up to the day you join, your points will still count._
